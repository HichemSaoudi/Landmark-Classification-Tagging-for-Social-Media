# Landmark-Classification-Tagging-for-Social-Media
## Hint
This project was realized as part of the Udacity nanodegree program "Deep Learning"

## Goal
This project aims at developing a model which

In this notebook, you will take the first steps towards addressing this problem by building models to automatically predict the location of the image based on any landmarks depicted in the image. At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input and suggest the top k most relevant landmarks from 50 possible landmarks from across the world. The image below displays a potential sample output of your finished project.

## Instructions
The project work includes the following steps:

- Step 0: Download Datasets and Install Python Modules
- Step 1: Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (from Scratch)
- Step 2: Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (using Transfer Learning)
- Step 3: Write Your Landmark Prediction Algorithm
Step 0: Download Datasets and Install Python Modules Note: if you are using the Udacity workspace, YOU CAN SKIP THIS STEP. The dataset can be found in the /data folder and all required Python modules have been installed in the workspace.

## Dataset
landmark dataset

# The following python modules must be installed:
cv2
matplotlib
numpy
PIL
torch
torchvision
## - Step 1: Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (from Scratch)
In this step, you will create a CNN that classifies landmarks. You must create your CNN from scratch (so, you can't use transfer learning yet!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 20%.

Question 2: Outline the steps you took to get to your final CNN architecture and your reasoning at each step.

## - Step 2: Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (using Transfer Learning)
You will now use transfer learning to create a CNN that can identify landmarks from images. Your CNN must attain at least 60% accuracy on the test set.

Question 3: Outline the steps you took to get to your final CNN architecture and your reasoning at each step. Describe why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.


## - Step 3: Write Your Landmark Prediction Algorithm
Great job creating your CNN models! Now that you have put in all the hard work of creating accurate classifiers, let's define some functions to make it easy for others to use your classifiers.

Question 4: Is the output better than you expected :) ? Or worse :( ? Provide at least three possible points of improvement for your algorithm.
